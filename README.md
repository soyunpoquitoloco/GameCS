# GameCS
 
#For this project, I have a main.py file separated in sections. 
The first section is about loading and preping the png's, the gif and the buttons. 
The next section is about the different methods used in the level loop or game loop.
After that, we can find the setting of many variables
Then we enter in the game loop. It is separated into sections for the menu 0, menu 1, tutorial, and level loop.

There is also a Player.py file which is the file containing the Player class and its definition and its methods.

The assets folder conatins all of the png and gif used in the project.
The player data is stored inside the player_data folder in the form of csv files.

The game has a main menu, a selection menu, two levels, uses a pcb and its buttons as a controller, has a leaderboard, a pause menu/button.

!!!! UNFORTUNATELY, THE CONTROLLER WASN'T GOOD FOR PLAYER COMFORT SO IT WAS USED IN THE DEMO VIDEO (SEE UNDER) BUT NOT WHEN COLLECTING DATA FROM THE FIVE PLAYERS !!!!!


Here is a quick video on how it runs :
